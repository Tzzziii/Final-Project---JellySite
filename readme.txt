This website is a sample homepage for the website "Jellysite", a fun idea of a site pretending to be for Jellyfish activists. In theory, it would sell Jellyfish inspired merchandise, talk about different types
of Jellyfish news and other impactful stuff in the form of a blog-type news website.
There were some formatting issues such as the "read more" button not being where I wanted it to be exactly as well as some issues with the h1 titles not moving to a new line when the sentence became to long, etc.
I wasn't able to figure out the best way to solve the issue, so it was omitted completely and replaced with the idea of columns with titles only and if the reader is curious then the "read more" buttom will take them to the direct page with the full article.

Only three options lead to other webpages on the website - the "Home" page, which can be found at any point by clicking on the "Jellysite Logo" in the upper left corner of each page, the "Who We Are" tab, the "Contact Us" tab located on the top of the page
and on the bottom footer, and lastly the "Become a Jelly" option next to the donate/shop buttons. Every other page leads to a free-to use code for a sample Error 500 page. The creator of this code has been credited in the comments of  the code file.
